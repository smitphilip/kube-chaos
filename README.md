# Kube-Chaos

Kube-Chaos is little CLI tool, written in BASH (for now), used to wreck havoc on your **non production** Kubernetes clusters, purely for education porposes.

**PLEASE NOTE: THIS TOOL IS NOT TO BE USED IN PRODUCTION ENVIRONMENTS.**

Users are able to break components of their Kubernetes cluster, and learn how to fix real world issues.
